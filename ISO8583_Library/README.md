# ISO-8583 Library

In this folder you'll find:

1. dl_c_iso8583_v0_0_4_160708_allfiles : the source code from Oscar Sanderson ISO-8583 website: [https://oscarsanderson.com/iso-8583/](https://oscarsanderson.com/iso-8583/) where we can find a C-Language project to deal with this ISO-8583 standard

2. Installer : The MSYS2 installer which allows you to compile C-Languages files and create a `.dll` file to use it within other projects

3. iso8583_Compiled : The C-Language ISO-8583 project already compiled, if you don't want to waste time in doing this by yourself

4. NetCoreIso8583x64Lib : A .Net Core library project that aims to keep all of the complexity in using the `ISO8583.dll` compiled from a C-Language project so we will find some helpers to facilitate the use within .Net Core projects
