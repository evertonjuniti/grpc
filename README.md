# PoC - ISO8583

This PoC (Proof of Concept) project aims an implementation using a ISO 8583 library to reduce the payload in any request-response integration between applications.

I'll try to implement this within some programming languages (like C#, Kotlin, Swift and Node.js) and some different protocols (like REST and gRPC).
